# Heart Disease Prediction

Data Mining Project

Problem Statement:
Heart disease is a term that assigns to a large number of medical conditions related to the heart.
These medical conditions describe the abnormal health conditions that directly influence the heart and all its parts. Heart disease is a major health problem in todayâ€™s time. 
Our aim is at analyzing the various data mining techniques introduced in recent years for heart disease prediction using 13 different attributes
Effective and efficient automated heart disease prediction systems can be beneficial in the healthcare sector for heart disease prediction.
